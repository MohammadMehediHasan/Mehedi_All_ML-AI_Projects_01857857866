My uploaded files contain the following machine learning projects:

1. **Emotion Detection**: A project on recognizing emotions using various algorithms.
2. **Plant Disease Recognition**: Image-based classification to identify plant diseases.
3. **Clothing Item Classification**: Pattern recognition for categorizing clothing items.
4. **Predictive Maintenance Classification**: Predicting machinery failure using data analysis.
5. **Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder**: A thesis project focusing on detecting ASD.
6. **Taxi Fare Prediction**: A machine learning assignment predicting taxi fares based on data.


This repository contains various machine learning and pattern recognition projects showcasing practical applications of algorithms and models. Projects include **Emotion Detection** using Twitter text data, **Plant Disease Recognition** through image classification, and **Clothing Item Classification** utilizing pattern recognition techniques. Additionally, it features a **Predictive Maintenance Classification** project for machinery, a thesis on **Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection**, and a **Taxi Fare Prediction** model. Each project is implemented using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and various ML libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn. The repository serves as a demonstration of hands-on skills in machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling.
